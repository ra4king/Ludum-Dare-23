//Authors note : 
This game is created for LD23 Jam with the theme of "tiny world". 
The idea originally was to make a robot blow up planets thought over by djdduty and ra4king told to me by them. I find 
severe emptiness in the plot so I decided to write a complete story filled with all the bells and whistles! Filling it 
to the level I think should be acceptable. So enough of me babbling read on , 

//This is the background story : 
	There was a tiny planet in the vast expanse of the universe. A fairly beautiful one I must add as there was a robot 
who used to work there to tend to it, The creator of the robot is unknown for all robots come with a manufacture's seal 
but this one did not ! 
	He used to tend to all the passengers who used to visit his planet, but not many were kind to him. "Must be the vast 
emptiness of the space which hurt the travellers" he thought. 
	For years, could be centuries, passed by and his tiny planet was forgotten In the rush of time. His Planet today was  
desolete and unkept,  for travellers have long forgotten the planet and our robot has grown weak and frail, in his memory 
a new program is created what we humans refer to  as resentment and hate. He vowed to grow stronger and make his planet 
the most successful and the biggest of them all. 
	He finds a way when a accident bound ship lands to the surface of his planet. He takes it over by force, and so 
begins his journey on a path which is fuelled by the contempt in his memory.

//Gameplay 
	Game begins with the user being shown screens stating the back story. The user has to fight various planets with his 
Available resources. On victory he is provided with the resources from the destroyed planet

the resources are : 
oil <nuclear stuff ?
wood 
stone
metal
slaves 

//mechanics [ to be reviewed ] 

slaves + stone + wood = upgrade planet
metal + slaves = upgrade ship
metal + wood + oil + slaves = make new ships
oil = fuel

   The game ends when the user planet is blown to pieces, or he successfully clears the field of planets. 
 

//end Story [ grave Spoilers### ]

	The planets are done for the robot has won. his planet is the most resource full and the biggest in the universe 
but sadly it is the only planet left. His slaves die in the last battle of universe. He stands there as the victor 
He gets the world to see the might of his planet. 
	Yet after the victory He stands All alone, single, like they way He started on his tiny World  in the vast expanse
of the Universe.
